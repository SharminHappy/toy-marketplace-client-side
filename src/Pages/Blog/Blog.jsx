                <h1 className="font-bold">(1)What is an access token and refresh token? How do they work and where should we store them on the client-side?</h1>
                <p><span>Answer:Access Token:</span>An access token is a credential that is used to access protected resources on an API or a server. It typically contains information about the user or client making the request and the permissions they have. Access tokens have a limited lifespan and expire after a certain period of time, known as the token's expiration time. They are issued by an authentication server or authorization server after a successful authentication process.</p>
                <p>Refresh Token: A refresh token is a long-lived credential that is used to obtain a new access token once the previous one has expired. Unlike access tokens, refresh tokens are not sent with each request to access protected resources. Instead, they are securely stored on the client-side and exchanged with the server to obtain a new access token when needed. </p>
                <p className="font-semibold">The typical flow for using access and refresh tokens is as follows:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Authentication: The user provides their credentials (such as username and password) to the authentication server, which verifies the credentials and issues an access token and a refresh token.</li>
                    <li>Accessing Protected Resources: The client includes the access token in the authorization header or another appropriate method when making requests to the server's protected resources. The server validates the access token to ensure that the user is authorized to access the requested resource.</li>
                    <li>Access Token Expiration: Access tokens have a limited lifespan to enhance security. When an access token expires, the client needs to obtain a new one to continue accessing protected resources.</li>
                    <li>Refreshing the Access Token: To refresh the access token, the client sends the refresh token to the server. If the refresh token is valid and hasn't expired, the server generates a new access token and returns it to the client. The refresh token remains unchanged unless it's revoked by the server.</li>
                </ul>
                <p className="font-semibold">Now, regarding storage on the client-side, it's crucial to consider security measures to protect access and refresh tokens. Storing them securely helps prevent unauthorized access and potential misuse. Here are a few recommendations:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Access Tokens: As access tokens have a relatively short lifespan and are sent with each request, they are typically stored in memory or a short-lived storage mechanism (e.g., a secure cookie or local storage) on the client-side. However, it's important to note that storing access tokens in client-side storage may introduce security risks, such as cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.</li>
                    <li>Refresh Tokens: Refresh tokens, being long-lived and more sensitive, should be stored securely on the client-side. One common approach is to store them in an HTTP-only secure cookie, which helps protect against XSS attacks. Alternatively, you can store them in secure client-side storage mechanisms such as encrypted local storage or browser storage APIs that provide higher security.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Answer:<span className="font-semibold">SQL Databases:</span></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Relational databases based on structured query language (SQL).</li>
                    <li>Store data in tables with predefined schemas.</li>
                    <li>Ensure data consistency and enforce referential integrity.</li>

                </ol>
                <p className="font-semibold">NoSQL Databases:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Non-relational databases that do not use SQL as their primary query language.</li>
                    <li>Store data in various formats like key-value pairs, documents, graphs, or columnar.</li>
                    <li>Provide high scalability, flexibility, and performance.</li>

                <p><span className="font-semibold">Express.js:</span>Express.js is a minimalistic and flexible web application framework for Node.js. It simplifies handling HTTP requests, routing, middleware management, and response generation, making it easier to build web servers and APIs.</p>
                <p><span className="font-semibold">Nest.js:Nest.js is a progressive Node.js framework that draws inspiration from Angular's architecture. It is designed to build scalable and efficient server-side applications. Nest.js offers a modular structure, dependency injection, TypeScript support, and various powerful features like decorators, pipes, guards, interceptors, and modules. It aims to enhance developer productivity and maintainability for enterprise-grade applications.</span></p>

                <h1 className="font-bold">(4)What is MongoDB aggregate and how does it work ?</h1>
                <p>Answer:MongoDB's aggregate is a framework used for data aggregation operations on collections. It allows you to perform complex queries and transformations on data by using a sequence of stages in a pipeline. Each stage applies a specific operation to the documents in the collection, and the output of one stage becomes the input for the next. This enables you to perform operations like filtering, grouping, sorting, projecting, and computing aggregate values. The aggregate pipeline is a powerful tool for processing and analyzing data in MongoDB collections.</p>
